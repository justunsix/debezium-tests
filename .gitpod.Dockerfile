# Deprecated due to 2020-12 rollout of Docker and root privileges in gitpod https://www.gitpod.io/blog/root-docker-and-vscode/
# Gitpodâ€™s default image (workspace-full) comes equipped with Docker now, so all you need to do is run sudo docker-up, 
# and wait until the service is listening. Now start another terminal and use the Docker CLI as usual.
# RUN brew install docker
